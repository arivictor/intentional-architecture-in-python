You know how to write code that works. But somewhere between "it runs" and "it's maintainable," things fall apart. Functions grow unwieldy. Classes become tangled. Changes that should be simple ripple across your codebase. You've heard terms like Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design, but when you tried to learn them, the gap between theory and practice felt impossibly wide.

This book bridges that gap.

**Intentional Architecture in Python** is a pattern reference guide that teaches you architectural patterns through focused, isolated examples. Unlike tutorial books that build one continuous application, each chapter teaches a single pattern with complete, runnable code that you can adapt to your own projects.

**What makes this book different:**
- **Self-contained chapters** - Jump to any pattern without reading previous chapters
- **Isolated examples** - Each pattern demonstrated with its own focused domain (50-200 lines)
- **Theory meets practice** - Clear problem statements followed by complete implementations
- **Real trade-offs** - Every pattern includes benefits AND when NOT to use it
- **No framework lock-in** - Pure Python patterns that work with any framework

**What you'll learn:**
- **Design Principles** - SOLID, TDD, Domain Modeling
- **Architectural Patterns** - Layered, Hexagonal, Clean Architecture
- **Domain Modeling** - Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Events
- **Infrastructure Patterns** - Repository, Unit of Work, Factory
- **Advanced Topics** - CQRS, Event Sourcing, Specifications

Every pattern is motivated by a real problem. Every "rule" comes with a "when not to use it." By the end, you'll understand when to apply patterns, when to skip them, and how to make architectural decisions with intention.

**This book is for developers who want a comprehensive reference to architectural patterns that will last.**
