# Book Completion Plan

## Current Status

**Completed: 7 of 19 chapters (37%)**

### ✅ Fully Complete Chapters
1. Chapter 0: Introduction
2. Chapter 1: Why Architecture Matters  
3. Chapter 2: Test-Driven Development
4. Chapter 3: Domain Modeling Basics
5. Chapter 4: Single Responsibility Principle
6. Chapter 5: Open/Closed Principle
7. Chapter 6: Liskov Substitution Principle
8. Chapter 7: Interface Segregation Principle (just added)

### Remaining Work

**12 chapters still needed** to complete the full 19-chapter book:

**Part 2: Design Principles (1 remaining)**
- Chapter 8: Dependency Inversion Principle

**Part 3: Domain Modeling (3 chapters)**
- Chapter 9: Entities vs Value Objects
- Chapter 10: Aggregates & Boundaries  
- Chapter 11: Domain Events

**Part 4: Architectural Patterns (2 chapters)**
- Chapter 12: Layered Architecture
- Chapter 13: Hexagonal Architecture

**Part 5: Infrastructure Patterns (3 chapters)**
- Chapter 14: Repository Pattern
- Chapter 15: Unit of Work Pattern
- Chapter 16: Factory Pattern

**Part 6: Advanced Topics (3 chapters)**
- Chapter 17: CQRS
- Chapter 18: Event Sourcing
- Chapter 19: Specification Pattern

## Completion Strategy

Each remaining chapter requires:
- ~400-600 lines of content
- Complete, runnable code examples (100-200 lines)
- Test examples
- All template sections (Problem, Pattern, Implementation, Benefits, Trade-offs, Testing, Common Mistakes, etc.)

**Estimated total:** ~5,000-7,000 lines of new content

## Recommendations

1. **Complete highest-priority chapters first:**
   - Ch 8: Dependency Inversion (completes SOLID)
   - Ch 14: Repository Pattern (fundamental infrastructure pattern)
   - Ch 12: Layered Architecture (fundamental architectural pattern)

2. **Provide chapter outlines for remaining chapters** with:
   - Structure following the template
   - Code example placeholders
   - Key concepts defined
   - Can be expanded later

3. **Update documentation** to reflect actual completion status

This approach delivers maximum value while being realistic about scope.
